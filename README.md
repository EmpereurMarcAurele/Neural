# Neural
Neural v1.0 works fine.       
It's a basic version, for changing inputs and output, we need go to neural.c and neural.h
to modify neurons values.

nn.c provide a full array-based neural network. Based on most simply neural architecture:                        
3 layers : input, hidden, output.


For the other files, it's my personnal interpretation of a simple neural network.
Build on linked list and inspire from nn.c and other stuff on the web.
