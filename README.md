For multi-layers-perceptron:

nn.c provide a full array-based neural network. Based on most simply neural architecture:                        
3 layers : input, hidden, output.


For the other files, it's my personnal interpretation of a simple neural network.
Build on linked list and inspire from nn.c and other stuff on the web.
